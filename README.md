# Chroma in LangChain
This repository demonstrates how to use **Chroma** as a vector store within the LangChain framework. Chroma is an open-source embedding database designed for efficient retrieval of high-dimensional vector data, commonly used in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows.
This project shows how to embed documents and perform semantic search using Chroma locally.

## ðŸ“„ File Descriptions

- `Chroma.ipynb`  Walks through storing, querying, and managing vector embeddings using **Chroma** as the backend vector store in LangChain.

## Environment Variables
To use this project, you need to set API keys in a `.env` file in the root directory.

### ðŸ“„ .env file format
